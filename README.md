`SLVolumeButtonListener` is a class created by [John Papandriopoulos](http://jpap.org) in 2012, designed to detect and intercept when the user physically pressed either of the volume buttons on an iOS device.

It was originally created for [SnappyCam](http://thetechreviewer.com/software/snappycam-pro-review-fastest-ios-camera-app-ever/), a rapid-firing photography app from John's startup company SnappyLabs and was freely available on GitHub under the SnappyLabs account.

When [SnappyLabs was acquired by Apple](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/04/snappylabs/), the SnappyLabs GitHub account was deactivated, and this class was removed along with it. 

Before the account was deactivated, I downloaded this class as I was interested in implementing a feature in [iComics](http://icomics.co) that used the same mechanism, and I've had it kicking around my hard drive ever since.

In order to preserve this class in the hopes it still has educational value, I've made it available on GitHub again under my own account.
